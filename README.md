# Monzo Crowdfund Simulation

Personal tutorial only; nothing to do with Monzo officially.

## Reguirements
1. Given a sample set of pledges, choose the winning applicants. the total must be Â£2.5m or as close to that as possible, but not more
2. Handle the case where some applicants are unable to pay by choosing new applicants from the original set. also this could happen multiple times in the future
